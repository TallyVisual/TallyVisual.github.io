# BFM Axioms
There are three basic axioms of BFM that apply to any situation.

1. Lose Sight, Lose the Fight
2. Maneuver in Relation to the Bandit
3. Energy versus Nose Position

> ðŸ’¡ An [Axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

## 1. Lose Sight, Lose the Fight. 
Just a couple seconds of not seeing the Bandit can mean the difference between victory and death. 
It will be necessary to occasionally take eyes off the Bandit during a fight. 
Learning when to take eyes off is critical. 
Offensively, you cannot shoot at an enemy you donâ€™t see. 
It is relatively easy to keep track of a Bandit that is in front of you. 
However, defensively, an enemy that you cannot see can shoot you while you are unable to defend yourself. 
Do everything possible to prevent going [no-joy](../Glossary.md#brevity), but if a no-joy occurs, strive to get the tally back! 

As a general rule, keep looking at the [Bandit](../Glossary.md#terms) until it is: 
1) predictable, 
2) easy to see, and 
3) not threatening you. 

If in doubt, donâ€™t look inside the cockpit.

## 2. Maneuver in Relation to the Bandit
Nearly all maneuvering must be in relation to the Bandit. 
That means every time you do something with your airplane, it must be either a reaction to what the Bandit has done, or preferably, to drive the fight and cause the Bandit to react to you.

## 3. Energy Versus Nose Position
The last axiom of BFM is knowing when to fight an energy fight and when to fight a nose position fight. 
This boils down to either sustaining the current total energy state or cashing energy in for nose position to shoot or defend against weapons employment. 
When offensive, you generally maintain energy until you decide to employ ordnance in a controlled manner for a high probability of kill (Pk) shot. 
You then use nose position to employ ordnance.
Defensively, you concentrate on the Banditâ€™s nose position. 
When the Bandit threatens you, cash in energy to defeat his ordnance. 
When his nose no longer threatens you, concentrate on maintaining or regaining energy to keep him from pointing at you. 
In high aspect, you concentrate on energy when you want to maintain a high turn rate over time, and cash in
that energy for nose position when you want a small turn radius or an increased instantaneous turn rate to employ or deny ordnance. 
No matter what kind of fight you are in, at any given moment you should always know whether energy or nose position is more important.
