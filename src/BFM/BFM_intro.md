# Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM)

In the visual arena, maneuvering an aircraft to either attain a position from which weapons may be employed, 
deny the adversary a position from which weapons may be launched, or defeat weapons employed by the adversary is known as applying BFM.

BFM is the starting point to learn about air combat as it is the most basic form. All fundamentals start here. 

After BFM you can learn to do
 - ACM. Still within visual range (WVR) but now you are fighting together with a friend and helping each other.
 - Intercepts. A fight that starts outside visual range where modern aircraft might already shoot at beyond visual range (BVR).
